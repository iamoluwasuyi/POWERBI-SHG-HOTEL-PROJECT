Booking Patterns:
•	What is the trend in booking patterns over time, and are there specific seasons or months with increased booking activity?
•	How does lead time vary across different booking channels, and is there a correlation between lead time and customer type?
Answer and Recommendation
In terms of booking patterns, Splendor Hotels had more bookings in 2016 compared to 2015, 2014, and 2017. While it did well in 2016, there was a drop in booking in 2017. This is because of a decrease in bookings from online travel agents. This customer segment (Online Travel Agent) contributes to 80% of splendor hotel bookings. Therefore, Splendor Hotels should prioritize strengthening their relationship with online booking agents. Splendor Hotels
Customer Behavior Analysis:
•	Which distribution channels contribute the most to bookings, and how does the average daily rate (ADR) differ across these channels?
•	Can we identify any patterns in the distribution of guests based on their country of origin, and how does this impact revenue?
Answer and Recommendation
The distribution channel with the most bookings is the Online Travel Agent, it also has the highest average daily rate. As suggested earlier, the business should improve its relationship with online travel agents, if possible offer them incentives on bookings.
The country with the most booking and revenue is Portugal. Portugal brings in 31% of total revenue (9 million dollars) to the hotel. The least performing country is Madagascar which brings in a mere 44 dollars. Splendor hotels should focus its marketing effort and in Portugal, UK, France, Spain and Germany but more effort on Portugal.
Cancellation Analysis:
•	What factors are most strongly correlated with cancellations, and can we predict potential cancellations based on certain variables?
•	How does the revenue loss from cancellations compare across different customer segments and distribution channels?
Answer and Recommendation
In terms of cancellation, we have a total of 44,000 cancelled bookings agaisnt 75000 successful ones. The canceled booking is half that of successful ones. This is not good at all. On a closer look, i found out that majority of the cancelled bookings about 30,000 came from customers who made no deposit and more are in Portugal. I recommend that the business request all guest to pat at least 50% or the room rate at the point of booking this will bring down the rate of cancelled bookings.

Revenue Optimization:
•	What is the overall revenue trend, and are there specific customer segments or countries contributing significantly to revenue?
•	Can we identify optimal pricing strategies based on the Average Daily Rate (ADR) for different customer types and distribution channels?
Answer and Recommendation
Portugal, UK, France, Spain, and Germany is the country contributing the highest revenue, this revenue is coming from transient customers. So our splendor hotels marketing team should target mostly transient customers in these countries.

Operational Efficiency:
•	What is the average length of stay for guests, and how does it differ based on booking channels or customer types?
•	Are there patterns in check-out dates that can inform staffing and resource allocation strategies?
Answer and Recommendation
Splendor hotels have a total of 235,000 guests spending an average on 3 nights, since more nights mean more money, the hotel can run a promo thus; ‘’Get one night free when you book for 4 nights’’. Customers who booked from offline travel agents spend more nights (4) on average compared to other customers (3) except corporate customers who spend the least number of nights (2).
There is no check-out date in the data provided but check-in at Splendor Hotelis peaks between October and November hence the business should provide more resources and staffing during these periods
Comparison of Online and Offline Travel Agents:
•	What is the revenue contribution of online travel agents compared to offline travel agents?
•	How do cancellation rates and revenue vary between bookings made through online and offline travel agents?
Answer and Recommendation
Online travel agent brings in more revenue (17M) compared to offline travel agent that brings in just 7M.
Even though Online travel agent has more revenue, it still has more canceled bookings. Imagine if Splendor Hotel strengthens its relationship with online travel agents and implements the 50% deposit on booking, it will close the gap in canceled bookings and revenue loss.
